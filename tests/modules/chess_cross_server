Chess Module - Cross-Server Game Synchronization Tests (v2)
Tests server-to-server game state synchronization and visibility

NOTE: The chess module requires both players to be on the same server for game creation.
Cross-server support is for game STATE synchronization (observers on other servers can
see games, but players must be local).
